Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.\n",

    "First, we will create a new array from `nums1`, which will be `new = [1, 2, 3]`. Then, we will use two-pointer approach with the first pointer `p1` at the first element of `new` and `p2` at the first element of `nums2`. We will compare these elements on both the pointers to see which one is greater and which is smaller. If the element at `p1` is less than element at `p2`, we will keep this element in the answer, and increment `p1`. Again, we will compare. In this case, both will be equal. So, we will store the element, and increment any one pointer. Say, we increment `p1`. So, `p1` now is `3`, and `p2` is still at `2`. Here, we will update the answer with the value at `p2`, and increment `p2`. We keep on doing this till the end. Also, once a pointer gets out of an array, we will simply finish the answer with the elements in the other array.\n",

    "    - If `nums1copy[p1]` exists and is `<=` `nums2[p2]`, we will write `nums1copy[p1]` into `nums1` and increment `p1`.\n",

    "**Question:** Given an array of positive integers. We need to make the given array a 'Palindrome'. The only allowed operation is *merging* (of two adjacent elements). Merging two adjacent elements means replacing them with their sum. The task is to find the minimum number of merge operations required to make the given array a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make any array a palindrome, we can simply apply merge operation `n - 1` times where `n` is the size of the array (because a single-element array is always palindromic, similar to a single-character string). In that case, the size of array will be reduced to `1`. But in this problem, we are asked to do it in the minimum number of operations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: `arr[] = {15, 4, 15}`.\n",

    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if an array is a palindrome, we will use the 2-pointer approach. The left pointer points at the first element of the array, and the right pointer points at the last element. If the elements on both these pointers are the same, we increment the left pointer by one and decrease the right pointer by one, and do the same. If the elements on both the pointers are not the same, we will see which element is larger. If element at the right pointer is higher, we will sum the element on the left pointer with its right adjacent (if left pointer would have been higher, we would have added the element on the right pointer and its left adjacent). If after this addition the elements on both the pointers are the same, we will keep going further. If even after this addition the elements are not the same, we will again sum adjacents just like we did above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that for any array, the maximum possible operations to convert it to a palindrome is `n - 1`. The following is the algorithm.\n",
    "1. Let `f(i, j)` be the minimum number of operations to make the subarray `[i, ..., j]` a palindrome.\n",
    "2. We start from `i = 0` and `j = n - 1`.\n",
    "    - If `arr[i] == arr[j]`, we do not need to do any operations.\n",
    "    - If `arr[i] > arr[j]`, we wil merge elements at `j - 1` and `j`, i.e., `arr[j - 1] = arr[j - 1] + arr[j]`, and `ans = 1 + f(i, j-1)`.\n",
    "    - If `arr[i] < arr[j]`, `arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1] + arr[i]`, and `ans = 1 + f(i+1 , j)`.\n",
    "3. Return `f(0, n-1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left( n \\right)$, and space complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left( 1 \\right)$."
