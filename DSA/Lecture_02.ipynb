    "**Question:** You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.\n",

    "First, we will create a new array from `nums1`, which will be `new = [1, 2, 3]`. Then, we will use two-pointer approach with the first pointer `p1` at the first element of `new` and `p2` at the first element of `nums2`. We will compare these elements on both the pointers to see which one is greater and which is smaller. If the element at `p1` is less than element at `p2`, we will keep this element in the answer, and increment `p1`. Again, we will compare. In this case, both will be equal. So, we will store the element, and increment any one pointer. Say, we increment `p1`. So, `p1` now is `3`, and `p2` is still at `2`. Here, we will update the answer with the value at `p2`, and increment `p2`. We keep on doing this till the end. Also, once a pointer gets out of an array, we will simply finish the answer with the elements in the other array.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the algorithm is the following:\n",
    "1. Initialize a new array called `nums1copy` containing the first `n` elements of `nums1`.\n",
    "2. Initialize pointer `p1` to the first element of `nums1copy` and pointer `p2` to the first element of `nums2`.\n",
    "    - If `nums1copy[p1]` exists and is `<=` `nums2[p2]`, we will write `nums1copy[p1]` into `nums1` and increment `p1`.\n",
    "    - Else, write `nums2[p2]` in `nums1` and increment `p2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}\\left( m+n \\right)$, and the space complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left( m \\right)$."
