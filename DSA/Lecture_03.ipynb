    "The given rotated-sorted array is `[11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10]`, with `X = 16`. We will use the 2-pointer approach, with `l` pointing at the smallest element, i.e., `6`, and `r` pointing at the greatest element, i.e., `15`. In the first iteration, `l + r = 21`, which is `> 16`, which means we will do `r -= 1`. In the next iteration, the sum is `6 + 11`, which is `17`, which is again `> 16`, so we will look to decrease `r`. However, in this case, `r` is already at the first position. Hence, we will set `r` to the last value of the array, i.e., `10`. Here, `l + r = 6 + 10 = 16`, which is the sum we were checking. Hence, we return `True`. To move `l` and `r`, we can use the formulas `l = (l + 1) % N` and `r = (r - 1 + N) % N`. The algorithm is the following:\n",

So now, `p0` is pointing at `0` and `p2` is pointing at `1`. `p0` is at the correct position, hence we will move it up, and again up (since it is again at the correct position). So now, `p0` is pointing at `2` and `p2` is pointing at `1`. And so on. The algorithm is the following:\n",
    "1. Initialize the boundary of `0`'s by `p0 = 0`, boundary of `2`'s by `p2 = n - 1`, and `curr` by `curr = 0`.\n",
    "2. While `curr <= p2`\n",
    "    - If `nums[curr] = 0`, swap `curr` and `p0`, and move both of these pointers.\n",
    "    - If `nums[curr] = 2`, swap `curr` and `p2`, and move `p2` to the left, i.e., `p2 -= 1`.\n",
    "    - If `nums[curr] = 1`, `curr =+ 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left( n \\right)$, and space complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left( 1 \\right)$."

If we reverse all the elements in the original array, we will get `nums_rev = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

So, the algorithm is the following.\n",
